## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss on Monday morning.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.
-   The data structure you plan to use.
-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-   How you plan to approach this project.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
-   How you plan to keep your code moodular.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project.
-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.

## Project Components

### Wireframe

### Data Structure

### Representation of Markup

### Approach

I plan to closely follow the suggestions for what to do and in what order as outlined in the game-project repository.  If I find myself spending an inordinate amount of time on a step that is sufficiently complete but could be somewhat improved for aesthetic purposes I will remind myself to move on and return to it only when I have satisfied all other criterion of the project.  I will also do my best to allocate sufficient time for steps that I anticipate will be more difficult for me than others, like writing jQuery to handle browser interaction.

To backup/track my project, I will make frequent and descriptive commits to my project repository. I am not planning to attempt any of the bonuses barring a (possible) JQuery epiphany.

### User Stories

1.  As a user I want to be able to sign up and sign in.
1.  When an empty square is clicked, it will populate with X or O.
1.  When a player wins or there is a tie, the user should see a message to that affect.
1.  As a user I should be able to see the amount of wins for x and y as well as the number of ties.
1.  I should be able to change my password to manage my account.
1.  I should be able to sign out after a game.

### Creative Spin

I thought about creating a themed app but I think it's better for me to focus on creating a simple, minimalistic and clean layout.  One area I could focus on to that affect is styling an expandable sign up/in/out menu with jQuery and HTML.
